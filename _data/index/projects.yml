- name: NETL
  i18n: jalpc
  gh_user: sb1992
  repo: NETL-Automatic-Topic-Labelling-
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/jekyll.png
  desc: This is first project 
  
- name: Finding Donors for Charity
  i18n: leetcode
  gh_user: sb1992
  repo: Data-science-and-ML/blob/master/ML_project_finding_donors/project_finding_donors.ipynb
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/leetcode.png
  desc: This Project notebook employed supervised learning where NGOs reached out only to people earning more than $50,000 hence not wasting resources on others.
        Then try to predict individual’s income using attributes like education level, capital gain, occupation, age, working-class etc.
        FInally apply Ada Boosting and ensemble methods to achieve an accuracy of 86%.

- name: Creating Customer Segments
  i18n: leetcode
  gh_user: sb1992
  repo: Data-science-and-ML/blob/master/Ml_project_customer_segments/Project_creating_customer_segments.ipynb
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/leetcode.png
  desc: In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. 
        One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. 
        Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

- name: Link Pediction between Twitter Users
  i18n: leetcode
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/familycode.png
  desc: Predict the presence of links between Twitter users, given data in the form of a directed social network graph.
        The graph of network was transposed into a binary classification problem.
        Supervised learning techniques were applied along with different Ensemble approaches. 
        Finally, Gradient Boosted Trees with feature transformation achieved an accuracy of 85%.

- name: Video and Image Q/A System
  i18n: familycode
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/familycode.png
  desc: In this porject we break Video into image frames, train Cov-nets using inception3 architecture on time distributed layer and combine them with LSTM layer.
        We use pre-trained word2vec vectors on word queries and combine them with using LSTM layer. 
        Finally, Concatenate output of both LSTMs, add a couple fully connected layer and an output layer to softmax and give predictive words for the Video.

- name: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
  i18n: leetcode
  gh_user: sb1992
  repo: Data-science-and-ML/blob/master/ML_project_boston_housing/Boston_house.ipynb
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/leetcode.png
  desc: In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. 
        A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value.
        This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

- name: Text Generation with LSTM 
  i88n: leetcode
  repo: Data-science-and-ML/blob/master/ML_project_boston_housing/Boston_house.ipynb
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/leetcode.png
  desc: In this project we use LSTM recurrent neural network for text generation in Python with Tensorflow and Keras.
        we train stacked LSTM network on text sequences an then use this trained sequences as a generative model to generate new text sequences.
